                    <h3>Notes:</h3>
                    <p>All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you
                        invest.</p>
                    <p>Investments in target-date funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds.
                        The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an
                        investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually
                        shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based
                        on its target date. An investment in target-date funds is not guaranteed at any
                        time, including on or after the target date.</p>
